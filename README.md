# Three ontologically-annotated atomistic workflows

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pyiron-node-store/pmd03_demonstrators/HEAD)

Here we present three physically-meaningful demonstration workflows. They are built on the foundation of the [`pyiron_workflow_atomistics` node library](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_workflow_atomistics), and use the [PMDco](https://w3id.org/pmd/co) for ontological annotation of inputs and outputs where available.

## Workflows

### Elastic tensor

The [`ex1-elastic`](ex1-elastic.ipynb) notebook computes the full elastic tensor of an elemental crystal. A bulk unit cell is relaxed, then strained along each of its independent normal and shear components; a linear fit of the resulting stresses gives the 6×6 stiffness tensor, from which the Voigt-Reuss-Hill bulk modulus is derived. The demo uses gold with an effective medium theory (EMT) potential.

### Solute-grain boundary segregation

The [`ex2-grain_boundary`](ex2-grain_boundary.ipynb) notebook measures how strongly different solute atoms prefer grain boundary sites over the bulk. For each symmetrically distinct site at a relaxed grain boundary, it substitutes a solute, relaxes, and compares against the most favourable bulk site to get a segregation energy. These energies are then related to each site's excess Voronoi volume. The demo scans Cu, Ag, Au and Ni in a Σ5 aluminium grain boundary using EMT.

### Unary phase diagram

The [`ex3-phase_stability`](ex3-phase_stability.ipynb) notebook maps which crystal structure of an element is stable at which temperature and pressure. It computes quasiharmonic Gibbs free energies for competing phases across pressure and temperature sweeps, then locates the pressures at which their free energies cross to trace phase boundaries. The demo follows Pb through its FCC → HCP → BCC transitions with an embedded-atom method (EAM) potential.

## Installation

Clone the repository to get the notebooks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyiron-node-store/pmd03_demonstrators.git
cd pmd03_demonstrators
```

The workflows need Python 3.13. Installing the package pulls in the exact dependency versions the demonstrations were developed and tested with. We recommend doing this in a fresh virtual environment, so you get exactly what's needed and nothing in an existing environment conflicts with the pins:

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install .
pip install jupyterlab  # or any other way you like to run notebooks
```

If you already manage an environment you'd rather use, this step is optional, but the notebooks expect the pinned versions in `pyproject.toml`.

Drawing the workflow graphs also needs [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) installed on the system itself. The `graphviz` Python package installed above only calls Graphviz's `dot` executable, so `dot` must be on your `PATH`. Check with `dot -V`, and if it is missing, install it, e.g.:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge graphviz  # conda/mamba, any OS
brew install graphviz                  # macOS with Homebrew
sudo apt-get install graphviz          # Debian/Ubuntu
```

Alternatively, the `.binder/` configuration sets all of this up for running the notebooks in the browser on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
